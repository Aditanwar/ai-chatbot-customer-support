Build a simple AI Customer Support Bot web app using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (local Compass setup) as the backend, with Gemini API for generating smart and contextual replies. The bot should simulate real customer support by reading a small FAQs dataset, maintaining contextual memory per session, and escalating queries it canâ€™t answer. Include REST endpoints for sending and receiving messages, saving chats to MongoDB, and managing sessions. Add a minimal frontend chat interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that connects to the backend API. The system should demonstrate AI-driven FAQ responses, session-based memory, and basic escalation simulation, with a clean code structure and a short README explaining setup, API usage, and prompts.
