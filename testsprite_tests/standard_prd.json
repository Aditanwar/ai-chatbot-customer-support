  "product_overview": "An AI Customer Support Bot web application designed to simulate real customer support interactions by leveraging Google Gemini AI for intelligent and contextual replies. It integrates a small FAQ dataset, maintains session-based contextual memory, and supports escalation of queries it cannot resolve. The backend is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, while the frontend provides a minimal responsive chat interface.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Provide an AI-driven customer support chatbot capable of understanding and responding to user queries contextually.",
    "Maintain session-based conversation history to provide personalized and relevant responses per user.",
    "Implement a FAQ dataset to supply quick answers to common questions.",
    "Enable escalation simulation for queries the AI cannot satisfactorily answer.",
    "Deliver a simple, clean, and responsive web chat frontend that interacts seamlessly with backend APIs.",
    "Ensure a modular, maintainable codebase with environment configuration for API keys and database connections."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Express.js server hosting RESTful API endpoints for chat and session management.",
    "Integration with Google Gemini AI to generate smart, contextual responses to user messages.",
    "MongoDB storage for user sessions, conversation histories, and FAQs using Mongoose ODM models.",
    "REST API endpoints to send messages, receive conversation history, create and manage user sessions.",
    "Session-based contextual memory to maintain continuity across user interactions.",
    "FAQ seeding script for initializing the database with frequently asked questions.",
    "Minimal frontend chat interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript connecting to backend APIs.",
    "Basic escalation mechanism to handle queries that the AI cannot answer.",
    "Environment variable configuration support for managing API keys and DB connection strings."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User accesses the chat interface through a web browser.",
    "User initiates or continues a session with the chatbot, assigning a unique session ID.",
    "User sends messages via the frontend chat input which are forwarded to the backend API.",
    "Backend receives user messages, consults session context and FAQ data, and queries Google Gemini AI for responses.",
    "If the bot cannot answer a query satisfactorily, the system triggers an escalation simulation response.",
    "Responses are returned to the frontend and displayed in the chat interface in real time.",
    "All conversation data and session states are stored and managed in MongoDB to maintain context.",
    "User can end or restart their session, clearing or continuing conversation history as desired."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "The chatbot returns contextually relevant and intelligent replies generated by Gemini AI.",
    "Session management correctly tracks and stores individual user conversations without data loss.",
    "FAQs are correctly loaded and used to enhance response accuracy for common queries.",
    "The REST API endpoints function correctly, supporting message sending, conversation retrieval, and session management.",
    "The escalation mechanism triggers appropriately when queries cannot be answered by the bot or FAQs.",
    "The frontend chat interface is responsive, user-friendly, and displays messages in real-time.",
    "Environment configurations securely manage sensitive keys and database connections.",
    "Codebase is clean, modular, and well-documented, matching the described architecture and features."
